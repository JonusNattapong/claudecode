- `Security` for permission, sandbox, auth, and trust-related hardening
- `Internal` for tests, types, refactors, and developer-facing implementation work

## [2.1.180] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- **`!bg <command>` — Background shell tasks** — Shell commands prefixed with `!bg` now spawn as persistent background agent sessions visible in the `claude agents` dashboard. Commands execute asynchronously with live status tracking (running/completed/failed), exit code display, and stderr capture. (BgShellTask.ts, processUserInput.ts)
- **Dispatch input autocomplete** — Agent view dispatch input now shows inline suggestions for `@agent`, `/skill`, `#PR`, `a:filter`, and `s:state` syntax with Tab to accept and arrow key navigation. (useAgentDispatchAutocomplete.ts, AgentViewDashboard.tsx)
- **`l` keybinding to logout/stop agent sessions** — Press `l` on a selected session in the agent dashboard to stop it (first press) and delete it (second press within 2s). Added to the shortcuts help overlay. (AgentViewDashboard.tsx, AgentViewShortcutsHelp.tsx)
- **Width-aware PR column display** — Agent session rows now show PR information scaled to terminal width: narrow (&lt;80) shows status dot only, medium (80-119) shows `#number + dot`, wide (≥120) shows `#number + title + status label + dot`. Peek panel shows PR number and status label inline. (AgentViewRow.tsx, AgentViewPeekPanel.tsx, AgentViewDashboard.tsx)

### Internal

- **README.md, docs/commands.html, docs/index.html** — Updated with new background shell commands, dispatch autocomplete, PR column display, and agent logout features.

### Added

- **`disallowed-tools` in skill frontmatter** — Skills can now declare `disallowed-tools` (e.g., `Bash`, `Edit`) in YAML frontmatter to restrict tool access while the skill is active. Parsed by `parseSkillFrontmatterFields` and enforced via `alwaysDenyRules` in the SkillTool context modifier. (frontmatterParser.ts, command.ts, loadSkillsDir.ts, SkillTool.ts)
- **`/code-review --fix`** — Code review command now supports `--fix` flag to apply findings directly to the working tree instead of just reporting them. (code-review.ts)
- **`/simplify` rework** — Redefined as cleanup-only review (reuse, simplification, efficiency, altitude) with over-engineering/abstraction-level alignment detection via a new 4th "Altitude" agent. No longer does full bug hunting. (simplify.ts)
- **`MessageDisplay` hook event** — New hook event that fires before assistant message display. Hooks can transform or suppress text. Includes schema (`MessageDisplayHookInputSchema`), generated types, and `executeMessageDisplayHooks` function. (coreTypes.ts, coreSchemas.ts, coreTypes.generated.d.ts, hooks.ts)
- **SessionStart hook `reloadSkills` & `sessionTitle`** — SessionStart hooks can return `reloadSkills: true` (triggers `clearSkillCaches()`) and `sessionTitle` (auto-names sessions). Parsed from `hookSpecificOutput` in hooks.ts and surfaced via `takeReloadSkills()`/`takeSessionTitle()` in sessionStart.ts.
- **Plugin `skipLfs` support** — New `skipLfs: boolean` option on `github` and `git` marketplace source types. When set, `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1` is passed to git clone/subprocesses to skip LFS file downloads. (schemas.ts, marketplaceManager.ts, pluginLoader.ts)
- **MCP subprocess `CLAUDECODE=1`** — Stdio MCP servers and subprocesses now receive `CLAUDECODE=1` in their environment for session-aware behavior. (subprocessEnv.ts)
- **MCP list/get pending approval** — `claude mcp list` and `claude mcp get` display `⏸ Pending approval` for unapproved local-scope (.mcp.json) servers instead of auto-connecting when piped. (mcp.tsx)

### Changed

- **Model picker behavior** — Enter now saves selection as global default, press `s` for session-only override. This matches upstream IDE behavior. (ModelPicker.tsx)
- **Skill `simplify` alias removed from code-review** — `/simplify` is now a standalone cleanup skill, separate from `/code-review` bug hunting.

### Fixed

- **Stale "& for background" hint in shortcuts panel** — Removed the hint text from `PromptInputHelpMenu.tsx` since this shortcut no longer exists.
- **Loading spinner showing "still thinking" while tool running** — Reset thinking status immediately on tool transitions instead of lingering for up to 2 seconds.
- **Focus mode spurious "N messages hidden" count** — Added `hiddenMessageCount > 0` guard to prevent showing the truncation divider when no messages are actually hidden.
- **`claude plugin marketplace remove --scope`** — Added `--scope user|project|local` flag to match the interface on other marketplace commands. (main.tsx, plugins.ts, marketplaceManager.ts)
- **Effort-change confirmation dialog on empty conversation** — Added `messages.length > 0` guard to prevent showing the effort callout when there are no messages yet.

### Internal

- **PLAN.md updated** — Full implementation status tracking across all 20 sections with markers (✅ Done, ⚠️ Already existed, ❌ Requires Anthropic infra, 🔲 Not started)
- **README.md updated** — Added new features to highlights and commands sections
- **docs/index.html, docs/skills.html, docs/commands.html** — Updated with new features, examples, and version bumps
- **All 20 docs HTML files** — Version updated from v2.1.165 → v2.1.178

## [2.1.173] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- **Windows interactive startup keepalive** — Replace the Bun/Windows stdin `ref()` no-op shim with a real keepalive handle so the interactive TUI does not return to PowerShell immediately.

## [2.1.158] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **GFM Task List Checkboxes** — Markdown output now renders `- [ ] todo` / `- [x] done` as `☐` / `☑` checkboxes instead of plain bullets. Checked items use green; unchecked use dim.
- **Diff keyboard scrolling** — `/diff detail` view now supports PgUp/PgDn (page through files), Home/End (jump to first/last file), and vim-style j/k navigation in addition to arrow keys. Space also pages down.
- **`/usage` contributing factors** — Added "What's contributing to your limits usage?" breakdown section that renders when the API provides `contributing_factors` data.
- **`/recap` command** — New command for session recap functionality.
- **Agent view CLI** — `/agents` now opens an interactive agent view with `--cwd`, `--config`/`--manage` options. Supports `--json` for machine-readable output.
- **Ultrareview launch dialog** — New `UltrareviewLaunchDialog` component for streamlined ultrareview workflow.

### Changed

- **LogoV2 rebranding** — Updated all logo components (AnimatedClawd, Clawd, CondensedLogo, Feed, FeedColumn, LogoV2, VoiceModeNotice, WelcomeV2) with refined visuals.
- **Agent dashboard redesign** — Refactored AgentViewDashboard, AgentViewRow, and Dashboard command to use design system components (Dialog, Tabs, ProgressBar, StatusIcon, Divider).
- **Ultrareview improvements** — Updated ultrareview command and remote review flow.
- **Voice module un-gated** — Removed feature flag gate from `/voice`; voice mode is now always accessible. VoiceStreamSTT and voice mode enabled cleaned up.
- **PromptInput, StatusLine, Settings UI updates** — Various UI refinements to notifications, footer, voice indicator, status line, and settings pages.
- **Permission mode updates** — Refined permission mode logic and type definitions for clearer mode selection.

### Fixed

- **PowerShell cd built-in permission bypass** — `cd..`, `cd\`, `cd~`, and bare drive letters (`D:`, `C:`) now correctly detected as cwd-changing operations by `isCwdChangingCmdlet`. Previously these parser-level shortcuts bypassed the cd+compound guard in permission checks.
- **Bash PWD/DIRSTACK stale variable tracking** — After `cd`/`pushd`/`popd`, `PWD`, `OLDPWD`, and `DIRSTACK` are invalidated from the variable tracking scope to prevent stale values from being trusted across a cwd change.
- **Jump-to-bottom pill dismissal** — Tapping the "Jump to bottom" pill now dismisses it immediately instead of waiting for the next scroll subscription tick.
- **`/voice` native module crash on Windows** — `audio-capture-napi` caused Bun segfault. Wrapped in try/catch with Windows SoX fallback. Also removed GrowthBook feature gate so `/voice` is always visible.

### Removed

- **`/eval` command** — Removed the verification harness (`/eval init/run/compare/report/trace/doctor`) and its entire `src/eval/` framework. Not needed in this fork.
- **`/profile` command** — Removed profile module (profile command + profileManager utility). Not needed in this fork.

## [2.1.157] - 2026-05-22

### Changed

- **`/dashboard` redesigned** — Replaced the 3-pane bordered layout with a clean Dialog + Tabs design using the design system (`ProgressBar`, `StatusIcon`, `Divider`). Organizes data into 4 tabs: Overview (goal/daemon summary), Agents (run list), Daemons (daemon status + MCP servers), Tasks (task queue).

### Fixed

- **Duplicate CTX display in `/dashboard`** — Removed model/cost/cache info from the dashboard Overview that was redundant with the main app StatusLine, eliminating double CTX display.

## [2.1.156] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Visual Segmented Memory & Context HUD** — Replaced basic context percentage indicators with a vibrant, high-fidelity Segmented Progress Bar displaying live token distribution (System Prompt, Tools, Rules, Chat, and Subagents).
  - Integrated a 36-character HUD inside the prompt input warning (`TokenWarning.tsx`) with color-coded category bullets underneath.
  - Upgraded the `/context` command screen (`ContextStats.tsx`) with an increased 55-character bar resolution and a premium HSL-based TrueColor palette.
  - Implemented a mathematical proportional scaling context estimator (`contextBar.ts`) for real-time, lag-free token breakdown estimation.

## [2.1.155] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- **`/autofix-pr`** — Launch a remote Claude Code on the web session to fix CI errors and address review comments on a GitHub PR. Detects PR number from current branch or accepts as argument, launches with `githubPr` context, and registers a `RemoteAgentTask` for polling results.
- **`/loop`** — Run a prompt or slash command on a recurring interval (e.g. `/loop 5m /babysit-prs`). Previously gated behind `AGENT_TRIGGERS` feature flag; now always available. Accepts intervals in `s`/`m`/`h`/`d` suffixes and parses "every N minutes" clauses from the prompt.
- **Interactive Argument Ghost Text** — Command parameter hints now render as inline ghost text after the cursor. Typing `/goal ` shows `[condition]` in dim text; press Tab or Right Arrow to accept and fill the placeholder. Supports progressive hints for multiple args (`[name] [priority]`) and static argument hints (`<plugin-name>`).
- **`/plugin-details` / `/plugin-info`** — Show component inventory (skills, commands, agents, hooks, MCP servers) and estimated per-session token cost for any installed plugin.

### Changed

- **Remote Control enabled by default** — `getRemoteControlAtStartup()` now returns `true` instead of `false`. All sessions are remote-control-ready without needing `/rc`, `--remote-control`, or explicit config. Set `"remoteControlAtStartup": false` in settings to opt out.
- **`/autofix-pr` available to all users** — Moved from `INTERNAL_ONLY_COMMANDS` (restricted to `USER_TYPE=ant`) to the main `COMMANDS` array so fork users can access it.
- **`/loop` skill un-gated** — Removed `AGENT_TRIGGERS` feature flag requirement from the loop skill registration and its underlying cron tools (CronCreate, CronDelete, CronList).

### Internal

- `cronScheduler.ts` — Cron tools no longer gated behind `AGENT_TRIGGERS` feature flag.
- `useTypeahead.tsx` — Added `syncArgGhostText` for progressive argument hint ghost text.
- `useTextInput.ts` — Tab and Right Arrow now accept inline ghost text when present at cursor.

## [2.1.154] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Interactive scheduled task creation in `/task`** — Running `/task` with no subcommand now opens a form for name, schedule type, time/cron value, prompt, and storage mode. The form creates one-shot or recurring scheduled tasks through the existing cron runtime.
- **`/task scheduled` alias** — Opens the same scheduled task form explicitly while preserving existing queue-management subcommands such as `/task list`, `/task add`, `/task retry`, and `/task requeue`.
- **Interactive daemon control panel** — Running `/daemon` with no subcommand now opens an action menu for start, stop, restart, refresh, status output, scheduled task creation, and queue listing.

### Changed

- **Scheduled task docs** — README and docs site now document `/task` as the primary user-facing scheduled task workflow, with `CronCreate`, `CronList`, and `CronDelete` described as the underlying model-facing tools.

## [2.1.153] - 2026-05-21

### Security

- **Prompt injection boundary** — Worker task prompts now wrap user-controlled descriptions in `<policy>` + `<task_data>` XML tags with explicit system override instructions. `sanitizeForXml()` strips control characters and CDATA closure injection.

### Added

- **Task lease/lock system** — `leaseTask()` / `releaseLease()` / `expireLeases()` prevents duplicate task execution when multiple daemon processes or crash-restart cycles occur. Expired leases auto-recover tasks to pending state.
- **Retry dead-letter & backoff** — New `dead_letter` status. Exponential backoff (base×2^count, capped 1h). Tasks auto-move to dead-letter after `maxRetries`. `/task requeue` re-queues manually.
- **Project namespace** — `projectRoot` field on tasks ensures workers spawn in the correct project directory.
- **File watcher debounce** — 300ms debounce with self-write suppression prevents file-change-trigger loops.
- **Graceful shutdown** — SIGTERM stops accepting tasks → releases leases → kills workers → closes watcher → flushes queue → exits. Force kill after 5s timeout.

### Changed

- **Auto-start opt-in** — `autoStart` defaults `false`. Supervisor logs on boot: "autonomous agent auto-start disabled". Only explicit `/daemon start` enables it.
- **`/daemon status`** — Now shows `autoStart`, `dead-lettered`, and `last error` fields.
- **`/task show`** — Shows `projectRoot`, `lastError`, `deadLetterReason`, `leaseOwner`, `retryAfter`.
- **`/task retry`** — Returns `dead_letter` status when max retries exceeded, with instruction to use `/task requeue`.

### Internal

- `taskQueue.ts` — Queue file version bumped to 2 with migration path from v1.
- `agentLoop.ts` — Uses lease system for all task claims, dead-letter aware retry loop.
- `supervisorIntegration.ts` — Auto-start gated behind `autoStart` config, default `false`.
- `daemonMode.ts` — Proper signal handling with SIGTERM graceful shutdown and SIGQUIT force exit.
- Added 13 new tests covering lease/lock, dead-letter, backoff, project namespace, injection boundary, dependency chains, and scheduling.

## [2.1.152] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **24/7 Autonomous Mode** — Background daemon runs continuously, picks tasks from queue, spawns worker sessions, monitors execution, and retries on failure.
  - **Persistent task queue** (`src/services/autonomous/taskQueue.ts`) — File-backed queue at `~/.claude/daemon/tasks.json` with priorities, scheduling, dependency chains, tags, and retry counters.
  - **Autonomous agent loop** (`src/services/autonomous/agentLoop.ts`) — Core loop with configurable concurrency (default 3 workers), 30-min task timeout, heartbeat monitoring, and error recovery.
  - **Daemon mode** (`src/services/autonomous/daemonMode.ts`) — Entry point for supervisor-spawned background process.
  - **Supervisor integration** (`src/services/autonomous/supervisorIntegration.ts`) — Auto-start, 30s health checks, auto-respawn on crash.
- **`/daemon` command** — `start`, `stop`, `status`, `restart` subcommands for managing the autonomous agent.
- **`/task` command** — `add`, `list`, `show`, `done`, `cancel`, `fail`, `retry`, `remove` subcommands for queue management.
- **Supervisor IPC** — Added `autonomous_start`, `autonomous_stop`, `autonomous_status` commands to daemon protocol.

### Internal

- Created `src/services/autonomous/` with 4 modules (taskQueue, agentLoop, daemonMode, supervisorIntegration).
- Registered `/daemon` and `/task` in `src/commands.ts`.
- Supervisor auto-starts autonomous agent on boot (when enabled).
- Added 12 tests for task queue CRUD, priority ordering, status filtering, and stats.

## [2.1.151] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- npm publish: fix bin/claude wrapper to use bash shebang instead of bun import

## [2.1.150] - 2026-05-21

### Internal

- Bump version for npm publish
- Documentation rewrite with real source content (27 providers, 80+ commands, 40+ tools)
- Fix Windows CRLF normalization across docs

## [2.1.149] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Agent Runtime & Orchestration Engine** — Local-first, durable orchestration engine for spawning, checkpointing, and executing complex multi-agent workflows.
  - **`src/agentRuntime/` Core Engine** — Includes `orchestrator.ts` driving agents through step-by-step state graph transitions, checkpointing state to disk, handling manual or automatic pause/resume, and routing handoffs between agent profiles.
  - **`runStore.ts` with Secret Scrubbing** — Saves and loads execution runs locally (`.claude/runs/`) with robust token and key scrubbing rules, ensuring zero leakage of API keys (e.g., Google, Anthropic, custom keys) into diagnostic history logs.
  - **`toolGateway.ts` Security Layer** — Multi-permission agent capability gateway validating sandbox access and halting on guarded shell commands (e.g., destructive operations like `rm`, `push`) to request explicit human approval.
  - **`agentRegistry.ts` & `workflowRegistry.ts`** — Markdown frontmatter parser for `.claude/agents/` configurations and YAML validator for `.claude/workflows/` DAG pipelines.
  - **`reportBuilder.ts` Summarizer** — Generates standardized markdown outcomes summarizing agent steps, file changes, and test validations.
- **`/agent` CLI command suite** — Built-in slash command for comprehensive local agent management:
  - `/agent run "<prompt>"` starts a designated workspace agent workflow.
  - `/agent status` displays current background execution state and stats.
  - `/agent trace` shows color-coded step-by-step task logs.
  - `/agent pause` and `/agent resume` controls execution loops.
  - `/agent approvals` / `approve` / `deny` gates guarded shell commands and checkpoints interactively.
  - `/agent report` prints markdown diagnostic summaries.
  - `/agent doctor` tests configurations and workspaces health.

### Internal

- Registered `/agent` and `agentCmd` in `src/commands/agent/` and `src/commands.ts`.
- Added extensive agent execution tests in `tests/agentRuntime/agentRuntime.test.ts`.

## [2.1.148] - 2026-05-21


### Added

- **`/tools` slash command** — view real-time tool usage stats (call count, estimated token cost, last used time).
  - `/tools reset` clears the stats.
  - Usage tracking hooks into tool execution pipeline automatically.
- **`src/utils/toolUsageTracker.ts`** — module-level singleton tracking tool name, call count, input/output tokens, and timestamp.

## [2.1.147] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- **Self-hosted SearXNG search** — Docker-based SearXNG instance in `searxng/`.
  - `docker-compose.yml` with port 18889, writable config dir, and relaxed rate limiter.
  - Pre-configured `settings.yml` with JSON API enabled (DuckDuckGo, Google, Wikipedia, StackOverflow, GitHub engines).
  - Start/stop/restart/logs batch wrappers for Windows.
- **`/searxng` slash command** — `on`, `off`, `status`, `restart` subcommands.
  - Uses `docker compose ps -q` for reliable status checks on Windows (avoids Go template quoting issues).
  - Supports `start`/`stop`/`up`/`down` aliases.
- **Docs redesign** — "Terminal Luxe" theme across all 5 documentation pages.
  - Warm dark palette with amber/cyan accents, JetBrains Mono + DM Sans fonts.
  - Terminal window hero with typing animation and staggered line reveals.
  - Stats grid, feature cards with hover glow, callout blocks, noise texture overlay.
  - Shared sidebar navigation and responsive hamburger menu across all pages.
  - Consistent header/sidebar/footer layout replacing per-page inline CSS.

### Changed

- **Search provider auto-selection** — `selectBestDirectProvider()` no longer auto-selects public SearXNG instances (all return 403/429).
  - DuckDuckGo is now the default free fallback (always available, no API key).
  - SearXNG is only auto-selected when `SEARXNG_INSTANCE_URL` is explicitly set (self-hosted).
  - Applied consistently in both `WebSearchTool` and `MultiSearchTool`.
- **`.env`** — Added `SEARXNG_INSTANCE_URL=http://localhost:18889` for self-hosted discovery.
- **`.gitignore`** — `scratch/` replaces `scratch/index.json` to exclude Chromium browser cache.

### Removed

- **`scratch/` directory** — Deleted tracked Chromium cache (~700 files) including a leaked Google API key (`AIzaSyA2KlwBX3mkFo30om9LUFYQhpqLoa_BNhE`).

### Internal

- Removed `searxng` from search provider auto-select priority in `WebSearchTool.ts` and `MultiSearchTool.ts`.
- Registered `/searxng` command in `src/commands/searxng/` and `src/commands.ts`.
- Created `docs/features/searxng-search.html` documentation page.

## [2.1.146] - 2026-05-19

### Changed

- **Cross-provider structured outputs** — `modelSupportsStructuredOutputs()` now returns `true` for non-Anthropic providers.
  - `AnthropicAdapter`: maps `output_config.format` → OpenAI `response_format` (json_schema).
  - `GoogleAdapter`: maps `output_config.format` → Gemini `generationConfig.response_mime_type` + `response_schema`.

## [2.1.145] - 2026-05-19

### Breaking / Migration Notes

- Rebranded the project-facing name from **Claude Code** / **dek1milliontoken** to **Claude Code** across README, docs, terminal UI, onboarding, trust dialogs, stats, and logo components.
- Renamed the npm package metadata from `@jonusnattapong/claudecode` to `claudecode`.
- Added the direct global binary mapping:

  ```json
  {
    "bin": {
      "claudecode": "./dist/main.js"
    }
  }
  ```

- Updated install and launch examples from:

  ```bash
  npm install -g @jonusnattapong/claudecode
  bun install -g @jonusnattapong/claudecode
  claude
  ```

  to:

  ```bash
  npm install -g claudecode
  bun install -g claudecode
  claudecode
  ```

### Added

- Added **KiloCompact**, a local context compaction engine under `src/services/compact/kiloCompact.ts`.
  - Collapses verbose directory trees, glob outputs, stack traces, and large text dumps locally.
  - Consolidates redundant failed tool runs.
  - Applies keyword-based semantic pruning while preserving protected early and recent turns.
  - Returns compaction metadata: original token estimate, new token estimate, and compaction status.
- Added KiloCompact tests covering:
  - verbose directory/tree output snipping,
  - sequential failed tool-state consolidation,
  - token reduction behavior,
  - skip behavior when history is already below the target token budget.
- Added `/resume <N>` support.
  - A numeric argument resumes the latest conversation with only the last `N` user/assistant exchanges.
  - Example: `/resume 10`.
- Added `--resume <N>` CLI support.
  - Allows resuming the latest conversation with a limited history window.
  - Supports combining numeric resume limits with explicit session IDs where applicable.
- Added `limitMessagesToLastNExchanges()` in `src/utils/messages.ts`.
  - Walks message history backward and keeps only the last `N` user exchanges.
  - Used by both `/resume <N>` and `--resume <N>`.
- Added `sliceMessagesByUserLimit()` helper for user-turn-based message slicing.
- Added recent model tracking for the `/model` picker.
  - Recently used models are stored in the `recentModels` user setting.
  - Recent model list is capped at 5 entries.
  - Recent models are surfaced near the top of the picker for faster switching.
- Added `src/utils/model/recentModels.ts`.
  - Provides `getRecentModels()` and `addRecentModel()`.
- Added a dedicated statusline spinner mode.
  - Uses arc frames: `['◜', '◠', '◝', '◞', '◡', '◟']`.
  - Runs at 80ms for smoother statusline animation.
- Added background session improvements:
  - `claude ps`, `stop`, `attach`, and `--bg` now work at runtime, not only in build-time paths.
  - Added `--name` support for background sessions.
  - `/resume` now marks background sessions with a `[bg]` badge.
  - Background agent completion notifications now include elapsed duration.
- Added stream-stall recovery.

- Updated `/resume` command argument hint from:

  ```txt
  [conversation id or search term]
  ```

  to:

  ```txt
  [conversation id or search term or number of messages]
  ```

- Changed `/model` behavior so model selection applies to the current session, while pressing `d` sets the default.
- Changed resumed sessions to preserve the model they were using through the `sessionModel` transcript field.
- Changed statusline context usage handling.
  - The context bar now freezes to the last known non-zero usage instead of collapsing to `0%` during thinking, tool execution, or early streaming phases.
- Changed permission-mode cycling behavior.
  - `bypassPermissions` no longer immediately follows `auto`.
  - Permission cycling is now more explicit and less surprising across `default`, `ask`, `plan`, `auto`, `bypassPermissions`, and `dontAsk`.
- Changed spinner behavior so custom `spinnerVerbs` are not applied to post-turn duration messages.

### Fixed

- Fixed startup hangs caused by slow side-channel API calls.
  - Side-channel API calls now timeout after 15 seconds instead of waiting up to 75 seconds.
- Fixed MCP `tools/list` pagination.
  - Paginated responses using `nextCursor` are now handled.
- Fixed MCP SVG image handling.
  - Unsupported MIME types such as SVG are saved to disk instead of crashing.
- Fixed MCP config error visibility.
  - `claude mcp list` now shows configuration parse errors.
- Fixed grep-style command exit handling.
  - `egrep`, `fgrep`, `git grep`, and `git diff` exit code `1` are no longer treated as hard failures when the command semantics allow it.
- Fixed read-before-edit checks for `head` and `tail`.
  - Files viewed through `head` or `tail` now satisfy the read-before-edit requirement.
- Fixed image extension mismatch handling.
  - Files with incorrect image extensions can fall back to text handling instead of failing.
- Fixed skill file watcher file-descriptor exhaustion.
  - Non-Markdown files inside skill directories no longer trigger unnecessary reloads.
- Fixed session-title generation.
  - Task-notification messages are excluded from title input.
- Fixed skill usage in headless/non-interactive mode.
  - Skills are auto-allowed in SDK and non-interactive paths where prompts cannot be shown.
- Fixed side-query model fallback with custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`.
  - Side queries fall back to the main-loop model where appropriate.
- Fixed plugin cache-miss errors.
  - “Not cached” now shows an actionable `claude plugin install` hint.
- Fixed VS Code rendering glitches by reducing spinner animation color count.
- Fixed Windows background commands.
  - `claude ps`, `stop`, `attach`, and `--bg` work correctly on Windows.
- Fixed `/branch` after worktree entry.
  - The command now falls back to the original CWD transcript path.
- Fixed IDE model sync.
  - Model changes through the IDE picker now apply at runtime through `applySettingsChange`.
- Fixed `Ctrl+C` behavior in `!` commands.
  - Interrupting a shell command now kills the running process correctly.
- Fixed scrolling in attached background sessions.
  - `PgUp` and `PgDn` now work in attached background session views.
- Fixed redundant provider display in welcome/logo UI.
  - Provider prefixes are stripped where they would otherwise duplicate provider labels.

### Security

- Updated trust and safety copy to reflect the Claude Code name.
- Improved permission-mode cycling to reduce accidental bypass-mode transitions.
- Improved background-mode rejection messages so unsafe or unsupported execution gates are clearer.

### Internal

- Extended `LocalJSXCommandContext.resume()` to accept an optional message limit.
- Updated REPL resume flow to apply the message limit after deserializing resumed messages.
- Added CLI parsing logic for numeric `--resume` values.
- Added settings schema support for `recentModels`.
- Added model picker option reordering:
  - default option first,
  - recent models next,
  - remaining deduplicated provider models,
  - custom model input last.
- Added KiloCompact implementation and tests.
- Updated package metadata, README, docs, license, onboarding, logo, stats, trust dialog, statusline, REPL, command types, message utilities, and permission-mode utility.

### Notes

- KiloCompact is present as a local compaction engine and has tests, but it should still be checked for integration with the main `/compact` or automatic context-compaction flow.
