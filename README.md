# Ceph Code

Ceph Code is an independent, research-oriented **reverse-engineered rebuild** of Anthropic's [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI. The goal is a **runnable, buildable, and debuggable** terminal workflow from source—not a black-box binary—while extending the runtime with multi-provider routing, adapters, and engineering tooling.

> **Disclaimer:** This repository is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Anthropic PBC. The upstream Claude Code product is proprietary; this project reconstructs and extends behavior for research and self-hosted use. Review [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) before redistributing or deploying.

## Positioning

| Aspect | What Ceph Code provides |
| --- | --- |
| **Source fidelity** | Reconstructed CLI aligned with Claude Code's terminal UX, tools, and extension points |
| **Build & debug** | Bun/TypeScript tree you can `bun run dev`, type-check, test, and patch locally |
| **Enterprise-style surface** | Bridge/remote sessions, MCP, plugins, skills, agents/supervisor, voice, session memory, LSP—without requiring Anthropic's hosted-only gates for every workflow |
| **Our differentiation** | Declarative **multi-provider** routing (`providers.json`, `/model`), provider adapters, and dev utilities (`preload`, `codeindex`, `session`) |

> This is a community rebuild for engineers who need transparency and provider choice—not an official Anthropic distribution.

## Ceph Code vs Claude Code

A factual comparison based on Anthropic's public Claude Code documentation and this repository's source tree. Claude Code is the official supported product. Ceph Code is an independent rebuild/fork for local modification, provider experiments, and source-level debugging.

| Area | Claude Code (Anthropic) | Ceph Code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Status** | Official Anthropic CLI product with official docs, releases, GitHub Action, SDK, and enterprise deployment paths. | Community-maintained rebuild/fork. Behavior can diverge from upstream and should be validated before production use. |
| **Install/runtime requirements** | Official docs list Node.js 18+, supported OSes, internet access for auth/AI processing, and `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`. | This repo uses Bun/TypeScript for local development. Install the `cephcode` package, then run the `ceph` CLI command. |
| **Model/provider scope** | Built for Claude. Official deployment paths include Anthropic API plus enterprise hosting through AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI. | Provider registry currently includes 27 provider IDs in `src/services/ai/providers.json`, including Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter, Ollama, Groq, xAI, Mistral, Copilot, and others. Compatibility varies by provider. |
| **Terminal workflow** | Official agentic coding tool that can edit files, run commands, answer codebase questions, use web/MCP context, and act as a Unix-style CLI utility. | Reconstructed terminal workflow with local patches, provider adapters, extra commands, and experimental runtime changes. |
| **Permissions** | Official IAM docs list `default`, `acceptEdits`, `plan`, and `bypassPermissions`, plus allow/ask/deny permission rules in settings. | Source-defined runtime modes are `default`, `ask`, `plan`, `acceptEdits`, `bypassPermissions`, `dontAsk`; `auto` is included only when the transcript-classifier build gate is enabled. |
| **Subagents / agents** | Official custom subagents have separate context windows, configurable prompts, and tool access; Claude Code SDK supports building custom agents. | Includes local agent tooling, background/supervisor sessions, team/worker code paths, and an experimental durable `agentRuntime/`. |
| **MCP** | Official docs describe MCP servers for custom tools/capabilities in Claude Code and the SDK. | MCP support exists, with additional plugin-sourced MCP server loading and local integration code. |
| **Hooks** | Official hooks include `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Notification`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `SubagentStop`, `PreCompact`, `SessionStart`, and `SessionEnd`. | Hook system exists and is modified in this fork; behavior may differ from upstream and should be tested against this repo. |
| **IDE integration** | Official docs list VS Code-family and JetBrains-family integrations, including diff viewing, selection context, file references, and diagnostics sharing. | Contains IDE/LSP-related code and plugin LSP support, but it is not the official Anthropic IDE integration. |
| **GitHub / CI automation** | Official Claude Code GitHub Actions supports `@claude` workflows and custom automation through the Claude Code SDK. | Repo has GitHub/PR-related commands and automation experiments, but not the official Anthropic GitHub Action product. |
| **Search / browser / computer use** | Official feature set is whatever Anthropic ships and documents for Claude Code. | Adds optional local/self-hosted pieces such as SearXNG integration and browser/computer-use adapter code. |
| **Source and support** | Official implementation and support are controlled by Anthropic. | Source is available in this repository for inspection and modification; support is community/project-maintainer based. |
| **Best fit** | Teams/users who want the official supported Claude Code experience and Anthropic's documented behavior. | Engineers who want to inspect internals, modify behavior, test providers, or run research/self-hosted workflows. |

Ceph Code facts are based on this repository's source, especially `src/services/ai/providers.json`, `src/types/permissions.ts`, `src/services/ai/providerRegistry.ts`, `src/agentRuntime/`, `src/services/mcp/`, and `src/utils/plugins/`.

**Bottom line:** use Claude Code when you need the official supported product. Use Ceph Code when you specifically want a hackable research fork and are comfortable validating behavior yourself.

## What It Does

Ceph Code gives you an AI coding assistant that runs in your terminal, can inspect and edit a local codebase, execute tools, switch between model providers, and coordinate longer workflows through commands, agents, plugins, and project skills.

Highlights:

- **Multi-provider AI routing** through Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, Ollama, GitHub Copilot, and other OpenAI-compatible providers.
- **Runtime model switching** with `/model` and provider configuration.
- **Tool-based coding workflow** for reading, editing, writing, searching, running shell commands, using LSP features, browsing, and working with MCP servers.
- **Plugin hooks** for intercepting prompts, shell commands, tool usage, and file edits.
- **Skill loading** from bundled skills and project-level `.claude/skills/` directories.
- **Agent and supervisor workflows** for delegating research, coding, and coordination tasks.
- **Durable Agent Runtime & Orchestrator (PLAN I)** with offline-first execution, checkpoints, and interactive approvals.
- **Session and bridge features** for saving context, restoring work, and supporting remote collaboration.

### Compatibility Namespace

Ceph Code's command is `ceph`, but parts of the runtime intentionally still read Claude-compatible project and user paths such as `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/skills/`, and selected `CLAUDE_CODE_*` environment variables. This keeps existing Claude Code-style projects, plugins, skills, hooks, and settings reusable while the public CLI and docs use the Ceph Code name.

## Quick Start

### Install Globally

```bash
npm install -g cephcode
```

or:

```bash
bun install -g cephcode
```

Run it from any project directory:

```bash
ceph
```

### Run From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CephCore/cephcode.git
cd claudecode
bun install
bun run build
bun run start
```

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3 or later for local development.
- At least one provider credential, such as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, or another supported provider key.
- Windows, macOS, Linux, or WSL2.

## Provider Setup

Set one or more provider keys in your shell or `.env` file:

## Architecture

Ceph Code is built around a provider-agnostic tool execution loop:

```text
Terminal UI
  -> Command and keybinding layer
  -> Provider manager and adapters
  -> Query engine and streaming loop
  -> Tool executor
  -> Plugin hooks, MCP, LSP, agents, memory, and bridge services
```

Provider-specific SDKs are wrapped behind adapters so the rest of the runtime can process streaming responses, tool calls, usage metadata, and content blocks through a common interface.
