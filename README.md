# Clew

Clew is an unofficial, research-oriented CLI for AI-assisted software development.

It is a source-built reconstruction and extension project designed for local development, debugging, self-hosted workflows, and provider choice.

This repository is not an official Anthropic product, distribution, partner project, or supported implementation.

| Source-built CLI       | A Bun/TypeScript terminal application that can be built, tested, inspected, and modified locally.                              |
| Multi-provider routing | Support for multiple AI providers through provider adapters and model selection commands.                                      |
| Developer tooling      | Commands for context inspection, code review, simplification, research, plugins, MCP, LSP, sessions, and background workflows. |
| Local extensibility    | Support for plugins, hooks, skills, custom tools, scheduled tasks, and project-level configuration.                            |
| Research use           | A transparent codebase for studying AI coding agent architecture, terminal UX, provider routing, and tool execution.           |

## Features

Clew runs directly in your terminal. It can inspect and edit local codebases, execute shell commands with permissions, switch model providers, and coordinate longer-running agent workflows.

Key features:

* **Multi-provider AI routing** — Supports Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, Ollama, GitHub Copilot, and OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
* **Runtime model switching** — Switch models or providers during a session using `/model`.
* **Tool-driven workflows** — Read, search, edit, and write files; execute shell commands; query LSPs; run MCP tools; and integrate browser automation.
* **Plugin hooks** — Hook into prompts, shell execution, tool calls, message display, session start, and file editing actions.
* **Dynamic skills** — Load bundled and project-level skills from `.claude/skills/`.
* **Code review tools** — Use `/code-review --fix` to review changed code and apply fixes. Use `/simplify` for cleanup-focused review.
* **Model picker** — Choose global or session-only model defaults.
* **Plugin marketplace support** — Includes support for `skipLfs` when downloading plugin sources.
* **Local research workflow** — Use `/research <query>` for local-first web research and scraping workflows where configured.
* **Agents and supervisor** — Manage background agents, multi-step workflows, summaries, task status, approvals, and session state.
* **Background shell commands** — Run long-lived commands with `!bg <command>`.
* **Scheduled tasks** — Create one-shot or recurring tasks through `/task`.
* **Sessions and bridge mode** — Save, resume, and coordinate development sessions.

## Quick Start

### Install Globally

```bash
npm install -g @jonusnattapong/claudecode
```

Or:

```bash
bun install -g @jonusnattapong/claudecode
```

Run the CLI inside a project directory:

```bash
clew
```

> The global launcher requires Bun to be installed on your machine.

### Run From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JonusNattapong/claudecode.git
cd claudecode

bun install
bun run build
bun run start
```

For development:

```bash
bun run dev
```

## System Requirements

* Bun 1.3 or higher
* Node.js 18 or higher
* Git
* Windows, macOS, Linux, or WSL2
* At least one supported provider API key, unless using a local provider such as Ollama

## Provider Configuration

Set provider keys in your shell or in a local `.env` file.

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
export OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
```

Switch models or providers inside a session:

```text
/model
/model list
/model openai/gpt-4o
/model google/gemini-2.5-pro
```

Provider documentation:

```text
docs/providers.html
```

## Frequently Used Commands

```text
/model        Switch models or providers
/status       Show provider, session, and context status
/doctor       Run diagnostics
/context      Inspect active context usage
/compact      Compress conversation history
/mcp          Manage Model Context Protocol servers
/code-review  Review changed code for bugs
/simplify     Run cleanup-focused review
/plugin       Manage plugins and hooks
/bridge       Configure bridge mode
/agent        Manage background agent workflows
/daemon       Open autonomous daemon dashboard
/task         Create or manage scheduled tasks
```

Type `/` in the CLI prompt to view available commands.

## Scheduled Tasks

The scheduled task system is available through `/task`.

```text
/task
```

Examples:

```text
/task
Name: Server Check
Schedule: Daily
Time: 20:00
Prompt: Verify the status of local servers
Storage: Durable
```

```text
/task
Name: Commit Reminder
Schedule: In N minutes
Delay: 10
Prompt: Remind me to commit the code
Storage: Session-only
```

Task behavior:

* Durable tasks are saved to `.claude/scheduled_tasks.json`.
* Session-only tasks run only during the active session.
* Recurring tasks use standard 5-field cron syntax.
* One-shot tasks are removed after they run.
* Local machine timezone is used for scheduled execution.

## Development

```bash
bun run dev              # Start development mode
bun run start            # Run the CLI from source
bun run build            # Build into dist/
bun test                 # Run tests
bun x tsc --noEmit       # Type check
bun run lint:check       # Check Biome lint rules
bun run format:check     # Check Biome formatting
bun run check:ci         # Run Biome CI validation
```

Developer utilities:

```bash
bun run preload <module>     # Preload module context
bun run session <command>    # Save, list, or restore session context
bun run codegraph            # Generate module dependency graphs
bun run ast-grep -- <args>   # Run structural AST search or rewrite
```
